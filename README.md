# SargeAI-Genesys

This is the stock 1.5.2 SargeAI Framework that you can still download. Right out of the box it does "function" in Epoch 1.0.6.1 but with an extreme amount of errors.
I have already modified this version to eliminate most errors, however, most of the Urban Patrol Script is broken. Here is where we begin to demolish the myth that Sarge is dead!
